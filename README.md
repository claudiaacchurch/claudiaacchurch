- 👋 Hi, I’m @claudiaacchurch
I’m currently learning web development in Python, c#, JavaScript, and Ruby. 
This is my second Github because I am now ready to start creating my own code which I want seperate from my learning journey (which can be found @7camc7).
I’m looking to start utilising my skills to work with others.
